### Variational Inference for Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Gaussian Processes

An extension to *Nonlinear Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Gaussian Processes* (Levine et al., NIPS 2011) that adds variational inference.

See `singletest.m` for examples of how to run the algorithm and generate various plots.
